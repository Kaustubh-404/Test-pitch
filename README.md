# AION PITCH SCRIPT
**Duration: 5-7 minutes**

---

## SLIDE 1: OPENING (Title Slide)
**[Duration: 15 seconds]**

"Good [morning/afternoon] everyone. My name is [Your Name], and I'm here to introduce you to **AION**—the future of payments.

We're building the world's first crypto credit card where your assets earn yield while you spend, and your credit limit grows automatically. No liquidation risk. No selling your crypto. Just spend, earn, and grow."

---

## SLIDE 2: AGENDA
**[Duration: 10 seconds]**

"Today, I'll walk you through the problem we're solving, our unique solution, our go-to-market strategy, business model, roadmap, and the team making this happen. Let's dive in."

---

## SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM
**[Duration: 60-75 seconds]**

"Let me paint you a picture of what's broken in crypto payments today.

**First—Broken Credit Access.** 63% of crypto holders want to spend their assets without selling them. But there's no real solution. If you hold Bitcoin or USDC and need to buy something, you're forced to liquidate—missing out on future gains.

**Second—No Credit Growth.** Existing crypto cards like Nexo or BitPay either lock your collateral without earning yield, or force you to liquidate assets entirely. You lose growth potential just to spend.

**Third—Primitive Payments.** Current crypto cards are just prepaid debit cards. There's no credit building, no credit growth—just spend until your balance hits zero.

**And finally—The Missing Link.** In DeFi, every loan resets to zero trust. There's no portable credit history. That means users are stuck in perpetual overcollateralization—you can never graduate to better terms, no matter how many times you've proven yourself.

The result? **Current credit systems are inefficient**—traditional ones are centralized and debt-driven, while DeFi models restrict liquidity and limit growth.

We need a decentralized credit system where borrowing is powered by **yield growth** instead of liquidation risk."

---

## SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION
**[Duration: 75-90 seconds]**

"That's where **AION** comes in.

AION is the first on-chain crypto credit card that lets you spend while your assets earn. Here's how it works:

**First—On-Chain Crypto Native Credit Card.** You stake USDC and get instant credit with **zero liquidation risk**. Your assets stay staked in DeFi protocols, earning 3-4% annual yield while you spend freely.

**Second—Yield-Linked Credit Growth.** Your credit limit automatically grows as your staked assets generate yield. This is the only card that **pays itself off over time**. You're spending from growth, not from your principal.

**Third—On-Chain Credit Reputation.** Every repayment you make builds a wallet-bound credit score directly on the Aptos blockchain. Over time, you unlock higher credit limits and eventually graduate to **unsecured credit**—no more overcollateralization forever.

**Fourth—Sustainable Liquidity System.** Liquidity providers earn yield by supplying capital to our lending pools. The protocol stays overcollateralized, and yield distribution is automated and transparent through **Move smart contracts** on Aptos.

So instead of choosing between holding your crypto or spending it, with AION you get **both**—you spend, you earn, and you build credit history on-chain."

## SLIDE 5: GTM STRATEGY
**[Duration: 60 seconds]**

"Now, how do we bring this to market?

Our go-to-market strategy is built on **strategic B2B growth** and **community-led marketing**.

**First—Top 50 Waitlist Program.** We're selecting the top 50 high-value users from our waitlist based on wallet holdings. They get VIP early access, boosted APY, and founding member NFT badges. These are our evangelists.

**Second—Strategic Partnerships.** We're collaborating with wallets like Petra and Martian, on-ramp providers, and NFT communities within the Aptos ecosystem to enable seamless card access from day one.

**Third—Influencer-Led Growth.** We're partnering with 10 crypto Twitter micro-influencers to create authentic demo content. Our target: **200,000 impressions, 1,000 waitlist signups, and 200 activated stakers** in the first 90 days.

**Fourth—Community Rewards.** We're running 'Spend-to-Earn' campaigns where users earn boosted credit limits and yield multipliers for consistent usage and on-time repayment. This gamifies good credit behavior and drives retention."

---

## SLIDE 6: BUSINESS MODEL
**[Duration: 60 seconds]**

"Let's talk about how AION makes money—and how we create sustainable value.

Our business model aligns user growth with protocol growth through four revenue streams:

**First—Yield Spread.** AION earns the margin between what borrowers pay and what liquidity providers earn. For example: borrowers pay 5% APY, LPs earn 4%, and AION keeps 1% as protocol revenue.

**Second—Borrower Interest.** Users only pay interest on **utilized credit**, not their total staked assets. This keeps rates competitive and incentivizes spending.

**Third—Fees and Premium Tiers.** Tap-to-pay transactions generate small protocol fees. We also offer Gold and Platinum tiers that unlock better yields and lower interest rates, which boosts retention and lifetime value.

**Fourth—Sustainable Flywheel.** Borrowers spend, LPs earn, and AION grows. It's a self-reinforcing system driven by yield, usage, and trust.

This isn't just a business model—it's an **economic flywheel** that gets stronger as more people use the platform."

## SLIDE 7: WHAT WE NEED
**[Duration: 45 seconds]**

"To bring this vision to life, we need three key things from the Aptos ecosystem:

**First—Complete Visa Card Issuer Partnerships.** We're in active discussions with Rain and Reap to finalize card issuance agreements and integrate KYC/AML compliance infrastructure.

**Second—Aptos Foundation Grants.** We need funding for smart contract security audits, compliance reviews, and marketing campaigns to drive user acquisition across the ecosystem.

**Third—Co-Marketing Collaborations with Aptos.** We want to launch joint Twitter Spaces, podcast features, and community events. Cross-platform engagement and content partnerships will amplify our reach and strengthen the entire Aptos DeFi ecosystem.

With these partnerships in place, we can move fast and scale responsibly."

---

## SLIDE 8: TIMELINE
**[Duration: 60 seconds]**

"Here's our roadmap to launch and scale:

**December 2025—Card Issuer Partnership.**
We finalize agreements with Rain or Reap and begin closed beta testing with internal users on Aptos testnet.

**January 2026—Pre-Launch Campaigns.**
We roll out our 'Spend Without Selling' marketing campaign, complete smart contract security audits, and launch the early access waitlist program.

**February 2026—Mainnet Launch.**
AION goes live publicly with partnered Visa and RuPay card issuers. We deploy our on-chain credit reputation system—version 1—and enable global onboarding.

**March 2026 and Beyond—Growth and Scaling.**
We launch influencer marketing partnerships, referral programs, and scale user acquisition to **1,000+ active users** across multiple markets.

This is an aggressive but achievable timeline, and we're ready to execute."

---

## SLIDE 9: THE TEAM
**[Duration: 45 seconds]**

"None of this happens without the right team.

**Ankit Kokane, our CEO,** brings strategic vision and execution experience to lead product development and fundraising.

**Kaustubh Pardeshi, our CMO,** drives our marketing strategy, community growth, and partnerships across the Aptos ecosystem.

**Rishit Goklani, our Founding Engineer,** leads all technical development—our Move smart contracts, mobile app architecture, and integration with card issuers.

Together, we've already won the **Ctrl+Move Hackathon** with a $30,000 prize, validating both our technical execution and market potential. We're scrappy, technical, and deeply committed to making AION the default credit layer for crypto."

---

## SLIDE 10: CLOSING (Thank You Slide)
**[Duration: 30 seconds]**

"So to wrap up:

**The problem:** Crypto holders can't access credit without selling assets, and there's no way to build on-chain credit reputation.

**Our solution:** AION—the first yield-backed crypto credit card that grows your credit limit automatically while your assets earn.

**The opportunity:** We're building the credit layer for the Aptos ecosystem and beyond.

We're live at **www.aionpay.xyz**, and we'd love your support—whether that's a grant, partnership, or just feedback.

Thank you. I'm happy to take questions."

## Q&A TIPS

**If asked about security:**
"We're prioritizing third-party audits for all Move smart contracts and implementing multi-sig wallet infrastructure for fund security. Security isn't optional—it's our foundation."

**If asked about competition:**
"Nexo and BitPay offer prepaid debit cards. We're the only platform offering true credit with yield-linked growth and on-chain reputation building. It's a fundamentally different model."

**If asked about regulations:**
"We're partnering with licensed card issuers like Rain and Reap who handle KYC/AML compliance. We're building infrastructure that's decentralized where it matters and compliant where it must be."

**If asked about traction:**
"We won the Ctrl+Move Hackathon with $30K in prizes, we're in active partnership discussions with Rain and Reap, and we're building our waitlist now ahead of our December beta launch."
